Healing isn\u2019t a race.\n\nI\u2019m recovering.\nSlowly. Gently. One day at a time.\n\nTrying to find my rhythm again - without burning myself out.\n\nIf you\u2019re going through something right now - whether it\u2019s physical, mental, emotional -\n\nPlease know: it\u2019s okay to pause.\n - It\u2019s okay to fall behind.\n - It\u2019s okay to not be okay.\n\nYou owe no one an explanation for choosing your peace.\nI\u2019m still in that space - of reflection, realignment, and rebuilding.\n\nI\u2019m coming back - one little step at a time.",
