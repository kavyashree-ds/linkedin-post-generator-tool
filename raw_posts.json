Logged off. Focused on healing.\n\nAnd now, step by step - I’m finding my way back.\nNot rushing. Just rebuilding - slowly and mindfully.\n\nTo everyone who checked in: thank you.\nTo everyone else navigating tough times: I see you. Take your time. Healing isn’t a race.\n\nI’m recovering.\nSlowly. Gently. One day at a time.\n\nTrying to find my rhythm again - without burning myself out.\n\nIf you’re going through something right now - whether it’s physical, mental, emotional -\n\nPlease know: it’s okay to pause.\n - It’s okay to fall behind.\n - It’s okay to not be okay.\n\nYou owe no one an explanation for choosing your peace.\nI’m still in that space - of reflection, realignment, and rebuilding.\n\nI’m coming back - one little step at a time.",

Even if it hurts.\n\nGood people don’t suffer because they’re weak.\nThey suffer because they keep showing up - even when the world doesn’t deserve them.\n\nIf you're one of them:\nPlease don’t change.\nJust learn to protect your peace.\nSay no without guilt.\nTake breaks without explaining.\nAnd stop setting yourself on fire to keep others warm.\n\nBeing good is not your problem.\nNot knowing when to stop - is.\n\nThe world needs more people like you.",

No “collaboration opportunity.”\n\nJust a simple truth: If it's not profitable, it’s not worth talking about.\n\nInfluencing has become a business, not a responsibility.

But if even one person starts questioning the silence of people they follow, it’s worth it.\n\nAnd if the people with thousands of followers, with platforms, with reach… choose not to speak - then what are they even influencing?\n\nBeing an influencer doesn’t mean being brand-friendly.\n\nIt means having the guts to stand up, even when it’s uncomfortable.\n\nEven when it hurts your reach, followers. Even when it affects your paycheck.\n\nUse your voice for more than brand deals.\n\nOr stop calling yourself an influencer.\n\nSo the next time you see someone flexing their 'personal brand' and hashtag#InfluencerLife, ask them one question:\n\nWhat do you stand for when no one’s watching?\n\nHere's one person posting an offer letter that looks like it's made on the word with an affiliate link and I'll leave it up to you now, decide who you want to support!\n\ntagging Ramesh Kumar because he's doing some exceptional work in this!",
